## Abstract
 Abstract. We present our contribution to the 7th ABAW challenge at ECCV2024, by utilizing a Dual-Direction Attention Mixed Feature Net work (DDAMFN) for multitask facial expression recognition, we achieve results far beyond the proposed baseline for the Multi-Task ABAW challenge. Our proposal uses the well-known DDAMFN architecture as base to effectively predict valence-arousal, emotion recognition, and facial action units. We demonstrate the architecture ability to handle these tasks simultaneously, providing insights into its architecture and the rationale behind its design. Additionally, we compare our results for a multitask solution with independent single-task performance.
